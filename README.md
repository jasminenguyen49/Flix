I encountered an issue regarding imageview size. When I click on the Superhero tab, the image size is so tiny. However, the issue was fixed. Setting estimate size to None fixed the issue.

### Notes
I have encountered several problems when I worked on BONUS. For example, I was able to run my app on a real device. Flix icon and launch icon worked, Flix's functions did not work due to Threads, which I do not know how to solve it yet.
